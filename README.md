# bad-file-names

A silly little program that generates "bad" filenames... then posts them to Twitter.

'tweetfilename.py' will attempt to import Twitter consumer keys and access tokens from a file called 'twitterauth.py' which must exist in the same directory as 'tweetfilename.py' and must include values for 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret', 'access_token', and 'access_token_secret'. See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tweet-using-python/ for info/help.
