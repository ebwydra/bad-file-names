# bad-file-names

A silly little program that generates "bad" filenames... then posts them to Twitter.

The 'tweetfilename.py' program will attempt to import Twitter consumer keys and access tokens from a file called 'twitterauth.py' which must exist in the same directory as 'capapi.py' and must include values for 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret', 'access_token', and 'access_token_secret'.
